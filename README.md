# Anime image download bot

This app downloads all links submitted within a certain thread  
Current development stage: able to fetch top comments from a certain thread

## How it works
clone this repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/WilliamHuang1995/anime_images_download_bot`

edit your config.json with your credentials  

install dependencies  
`npm install`  
start the program  
`npn start`

### Back Log
create database  
grab post from autolovepon instead  
dockerize database (maybe)  
make a front end for users who don't know how to program

### To Fix
fix links for https://imgur.com/link (figure out regex)  
download albums  
https://imgur.com/Iq3rilC  
links where they use url as the link
